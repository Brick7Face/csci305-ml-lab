Lab Questions
=======================
1. The output I get when running f [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9] is [4, 2, 5, 2, 6, 10].

2. The function f appears to add 1 to all of the numbers in the input list, so the list that
is returned is the same list with all the values increased by 1.

3. Line (a) is the base case line - if the input list is empty, return an empty list.

4. Line (b) is the recursive line - given an input list, take the head and add 1. The tail of
the list is sent through the function f again, and the result is cons-ed to the head plus 1 value.
