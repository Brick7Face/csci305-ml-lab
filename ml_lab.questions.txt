Lab Questions
=======================
1. The output I get when running f [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9] is [4, 2, 5, 2, 6, 10].

2. The function f appears to add 1 to all of the numbers in the input list, so the list that
is returned is the same list with all the values increased by 1.

3. Line (a) is the base case line - if the input list is empty, return an empty list.

4. Line (b) is the recursive line - given an input list, take the head and add 1. The tail of
the list is sent through the function f again, and the result is cons-ed to the head plus 1 value.

5. false

6. Tail recursion; the last thing that the program does before returning is recursive, making it tail recursive.

7.  Set ("it",Set ("was",Set ("the",Set ("best",Set ("of",Set ("times,",Set ("worst",Set ("times",Empty))))))))
- cleaned up, it looks like { it was the best of times, worst times }

8. Tail recursive functions allow the compiler to optimize the function, as it does not have to worry
about saving the function's stack frame. This is because the rest of the function has already been 
executed and the last thing to do is the recursive part. This kind of code is also called tail call
elimination. In general, it makes compilation more efficient.

11. I like how functions can be written in a "tricky" way using recursion - it feels like the most elegant way to do things,
as if each function is being written in one line (and it sort of is, in a sense). Though it requires some difficult thought
sometimes, it is a cool way of doing things.

12. That being said, while it is cool, I do not like the structure that the programs must follow. The recursive nature of 
functions require that steps all be thought out/written down and then implemented elegant code, whereas more familiar 
languages like Java allow the coder to write one line of code per thought, as the language requires it. ML definitely
requires a new way of thinking about programming.

13. I did not enjoy the lab when I could not get the functions to work; however, when I ended up being able to figure
out the syntax and make things run, I got very excited. That being said, I enjoyed the lab overall, those I prefer
other languages over ML. I thought the idea of defining your own datatypes and functions for them was interesting.
It was a good approach to learning it, too, as our "set" type was somewhat conceptually similar to lists, and the
functions were relatively simple. The difficult part was getting ML to do what I wanted it to do.

14. I probably spent around 18-20 hours total trying to figure out how to do each of the tasks, including tinkering in the
sml environment to figure out syntaxes and following recursion diagrams I drew on paper to track what the functions needed
to do.

15. I don't think so, but if I did, I would probably use it for a project where I would want to define my own datatypes
or one requiring a lot of math functions. I thought the recursion would be a good way to evaluation math functions.
At this point, however, I think that ML generally is just good to practice recursion with.
